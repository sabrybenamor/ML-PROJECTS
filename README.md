## Project 1: Student Mental Health During Online Learning

### Dataset

The first project utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle, comprising responses from students about their mental health status during the era of online learning. The data was collected through surveys and highlights a range of psychological and behavioral factors affected by remote education.

- **Dataset size:** 1,000 samples
- **Features:** 10 columns, including demographic details, lifestyle habits, and self-reported mental health indicators

This dataset is well-suited for:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Building predictive models to understand the impact of online education on student mental well-being

### Approach

For this project, I applied a logistic regression model using the `LogisticRegression` class from the `scikit-learn` library. Due to the limited dataset size (1,000 entries), the model achieved an accuracy of no more than 53%. This highlights the challenges of building predictive models with limited data and the importance of larger, more comprehensive datasets for reliable results.
